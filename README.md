# Computer Networks Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a full network infrastructure for a faculty moving to a new campus using Cisco Packet Tracer. The design includes different LAN topologies, subnetting, routing protocols, NAT, and access control for enhanced security and scalability.

## 🧩 Features Implemented
- ✅ 5 LAN topologies: Ring, Mesh, Tree, Bus, Star.
- ✅ Subnetting and IP addressing across two Class C networks:
  - 193.158.1.0
  - 193.158.2.0
- ✅ Two distributed servers over 7 locations.
- ✅ Two routing protocols implemented:
  - EIGRP (`projectEigrp.pkt`)
  - OSPF (`projectOSP.pkt`)
- ✅ NAT configurations and access lists for network protection.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Microsoft Word
- PDF for documentation

## 📁 Files Included
- `projectEigrp.pkt` – Network with EIGRP routing
- `projectOSP.pkt` – Network with OSPF routing
- `report.docx` – Full technical report
- `report.pdf` – Printable version of the report
- `network project.pdf` – Project instructions

## 📝 How to Use
1. Open `.pkt` files using Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Read the `report.docx` or `report.pdf` for detailed network design and decisions.
3. Verify configurations and observe routing behavior.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Apply different network topologies practically.
- Understand and compare routing protocols (EIGRP vs OSPF).
- Learn subnetting and network design for large-scale environments.
- Implement basic security through NAT and ACLs.
